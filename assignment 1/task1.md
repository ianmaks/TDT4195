# Task 1

### a)
To *sample* is to digitize the coordinate values of a function given by the waveform of the continuous voltage output of a sensor. 
In practice, spacial sampling is accomplished by selecting the number of individual mechanical increments at which we activate the sensor to collect data.

###b)
*Quantization* is digitizing the amplitude of a sampled value.

### c)
One can tell that an image is high-contrast by its histogram by identifying that an even distribution across the entire domain of possible values. Meaning that the pixel Iamge uses all available intensity values.

### d)
TODO ADD CALCULATIONS

### e)
Applying a log transform will widen (brighten) the low intensities and squeeze (darken) the high intensities. Effectivley lowering the dynamic range of the imgage

### f) 
To handle boundaries we chose reflecting the information across the edge, and on the coreners we used the same pixel as on the sides of the corner.
